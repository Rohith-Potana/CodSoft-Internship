# CodSoft-Internship
hello everyone! these two projects were part of my tasks during my internship at CodSoft, Banglore.
I had originally done these tasks in Jupyter Notebook, but recently I've been using Google Colab because of its convenience, so i decided to do these tasks in Google Colab and upload them here again.
The domain that I chose and worked on, was "Data Science", in particular "advanced predictive analysis", using python and some python libraries like Pandas, numPy etc.
In CodSoft-1,
  I use data science to create a heart disease prediction model.
In CodSodt-2, 
  I use data science to accurately predict the survival of passengers on the titanic, based on characteristics like age, gender, class and embarkment point.
